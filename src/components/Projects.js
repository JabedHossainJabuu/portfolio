                    I am a versatile developer with expertise in healthcare
                    solutions, React ToDo App, and various PHP-based systems. My
                    Online Health Care platform facilitates virtual medical
                    assistance from licensed doctors, while the ToDo App
                    enhances task management. The Online Birth Certificate,
                    Covid-19 Testing, and Daily Expense Tracker systems
                    streamline administrative tasks and essential services.
                    Additionally, I developed a Chatbot for seamless
                    communication and an Online Examination System for academic
                    efficiency. In the finance sector, my Online Banking System
                    offers secure transactions, and the Student Project
                    Allocation system optimizes resource allocation. Lastly, the
                    Online Ticket Reservation system simplifies travel booking.
                    My projects prioritize user experience and practicality
                    across domains.
